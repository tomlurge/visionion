README: producing sample data for Visionion
===========================================

Disclaimer: everything in this subdirectory has the sole purpose of
producing sample data for testing and developing Visionion.

To be even clearer: nothing in this subdirectory is meant to be used in a
production environment!

Okay, this should be clear now.  Here are the instructions for producing
sample data on Debian Squeeze:

Download userstats.csv from the metrics website and store it in this
directory:

  $ wget https://metrics.torproject.org/csv/userstats.csv

Install Java 6 for descriptor parsing and PostgreSQL 8.4 for descriptor
data storage and aggregation:

  $ sudo apt-get install openjdk-6-jdk postgresql-8.4

Create a database user and database:

  $ sudo -u postgres createuser -P karsten
  $ sudo -u postgres createdb -O karsten visionion
  $ echo "password" > ~/.pgpass
  $ chmod 0600 ~/.pgpass
  $ psql -f init-visionion.sql visionion

Create empty bin/, lib/, geoip/, in/, and out/ directories.

Put required .jar files into the lib/ directory.  See metrics-lib.git for
instructions:

  - lib/gson-2.2.3.jar
  - lib/commons-codec-1.6.jar
  - lib/commons-compress-1.4.1.jar
  - lib/descriptor.jar

Create the following three directories and put tarballs from the metrics
website into them:

  - in/bridge-descriptors
  - in/bridge-pool-assignments
  - in/relay-descriptors

Get IP-to-country and IP-to-ASN databases from MaxMind and put them into
the geoip/ directory.  At least the two following files should be present:

  - geoip/GeoIPCountryWhois.csv
  - GeoIPASNum2.csv

Run the run-visionion.sh script (requires 4G+ of RAM):

  $ ./run-visionion.sh

There should now be three output files in the current directory:

 - bridges.json
 - clients.json
 - relays.json

Enjoy!
